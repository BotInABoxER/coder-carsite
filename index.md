## Hello There!

Welcome to the official site of Project Rover, the latest open-source robotics kit from Bot-In-a-Box Educational Robotics!

On this site, you'll find all the information you need to put together a Project Rover of your own!

Project Rover is currently in full-time development, so expect things to change (*drastically*). Listed below is the link to download the STL printing files to 3D-print your own Project Rover.
