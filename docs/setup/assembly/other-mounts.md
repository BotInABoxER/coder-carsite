Currently, support for other mounts in CodeRcar is in Alpha. On the [CodeRcar GitHub Repo](https://github.com/BotInABoxER/codercar), you'll find a folder in the STLs folder called Extras, and there are mounts for an MPU6050 sensor, an Ultrasonic Sensor, an LED Matrix (8x8) and a servo.

More information (and a Breadboard Mount) coming soon!
