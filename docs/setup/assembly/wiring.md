Now that you have the Motors, Motor Controllers, and Raspberry Pi Zero W in place, it's time to wire everything up. Surprisingly enough, if you have all the right [parts]({{ site.url }}/docs/setup/bom/materials.html), this should be one of the easier steps.

Before you begin wiring, make sure you have gathered the following things:

- 12 Female-to-Female Dupont Jumper Cables (having all different colours except two reds and two blacks is ideal)

That's it, actually. So, what you have to do is fairly simple: connect the pins on the Motor Controllers to the proper pins on the Raspberry Pi Zero W.
