So, you've attached the Motor Controllers to the Body, and now it's time to attach the Raspberry Pi Zero W. This part is pretty simple, because you just need the Pi and four M2.5 screws. Place the Pi in its mount at the center of the Body. You'll want to make sure the ports on the side line up with the holes created for them, and that the microSD Card slot is accessible.

Carefully and slowly screw in the corners of the Pi, one-at-a-time, going in a diagonal fashion (Screw in one corner, screw in the corner that's the furthest away from it, then screw the corner closest to it, then screw in the last corner. This way you'll stop the Pi from bending or shifting around while you're screwing). Again, screw slowly until you hear a light crunching sound, then loosen the screw a half-turn or so to ensure that the Pi won't move, but that it isn't being scraped by the screws, either.

When you're done, it should look something like this:
