Now, for the Battery Box. It should have printed in two pieces (the Box and the Lid), and it should not be too difficult to put together.

You will need the following parts/tools to finish this step:

- An M3 screwdriver/Allen Key
- A Front Mount
- A Battery Box
- A Battery Box Lid
- 6 M3 Screws
- A USB Power Bank case and 2 18650 Li-ion Batteries
- A Small Flathead Screwdriver

First, you'll need to assemble the USB Power Bank. Put the 18650 batteries inside the case, and close it up carefully with your fingers, making sure all the parts are inside it and not sticking out. If you bought a case that came put together, take a small flathead screwdriver and carefully (i.e. without breaking it) pry off the lid of the case. Next, you can put the batteries inside it and close it up.

Once you have an assembled USB Power Bank, screw the Battery Box onto the top of the Top Mount with 2 M3 screws.

Next, slide the USB Power Bank inside the box, ensuring that it fits and that the USB ports are accessible.

Now, carefully slide the Battery Box Lid on top of the Battery Box. It's one of the only things in the kit that might be a little tight, so you might want to put it on without the USB Power Bank and take it off a few times to get a feel for how it should go and maybe to loosen up the plastic around it so it fits snugly but not too snugly (that you can't get it off).

This part is a little tricky, and you may need to grab the Lid with vice grips and tap the vice grips gently with a hammer to get the Lid on or off. Be careful not to hit your hand, since you really only need a little bit of force to pop off the Lid.

Finally, pop the whole Front Mount assembly on top of the Body and screw the completed Front Mount and Battery Box to the Body with four M3 screws.

Ta Da! You've completed the basic setup of CodeRcar! To turn on your Pi, connect a Micro USB cable from the big USB port on the Power Bank to the rightmost Micro USB port on your Pi (the one that is the furthest away from the microSD Card Reader, since the other Micro USB Port isn't meant for giving your Pi power). Eventually, the Power Bank will run out of battery power, so recharge it by plugging the Bank's Micro USB port into a powered USB port, like one on your desktop computer, or use a Raspberry Pi or Micro USB phone charger connected to a wall outlet.

*Warning - Please Read:* Lithium Ion batteries like the one's used in CodeRcar's Battery Box have a penchant of catching on fire when charged improperly. This shouldn't be an issue with high-quality batteries and a good charger, but it really isn't recommended to leave the Power Bank charging unattended or for more than it needs to be charged (two/three hours max should do the trick; the red LED on the Power Bank will stop blinking when it's fully-charged). If the Power Bank does catch fire, and you can safely unplug it without getting burned/electrocuted, do so first. Next, grab a fire extinguisher and use the PASS method to spray down the Power Bank. In a pinch, fire-retardent materials like dirt, sand, or a lot of baking soda _might_ work, but _never_ use water to try to extinguish an electrical fire. Obviously, replace the Power Bank and any cords attached to it if it does happen to catch fire.
