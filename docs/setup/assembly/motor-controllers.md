Before you do anything else, it is important to get the Motor Controllers properly seated in their mounts on the Body. This will ensure that the other parts and screws don't get in the way during the rest of the assembly process.

First, take a Motor Controller and place it in one of the rectangular divot with circular cutouts at either end of the Body. Put it inside the divot with the screw terminals facing out (i.e. not towards the middle of the Body). Next, screw two M2.5 screws into the holes beside the green screw terminals. Fasten them down slowly until you here a scraping noise. At that point you've hit the Controller's circuit board, so loosen the screws half a turn or so to ensure they don't rub against it too much.

Now that the smaller screws are in place. Put two M3 screws in the other holes, and repeat the same process when tightening them. Repeat the process for both of the Controllers, and your Project Rover's Body should look a little something like this on either side:

Now, it's time to attach the Raspberry Pi Zero W!
