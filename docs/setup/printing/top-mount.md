The Top Mount is a part that fits onto the Body, and it has M3 screw holes that allow for the attachment of a number of different things, including a Battery Box, a Breadboard Mount, and more.

The Top Mount is the second-biggest single piece of the kit, but it takes a lot less plastic to print it than the Body takes.
