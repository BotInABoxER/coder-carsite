{% include model-viewer.html file="wheel" alt="CodeRcar's Battery Bank Wheel - version 0.5.3" %}


The Wheels fit onto the shafts of the Motors, and a CodeRcar kit needs four of them. They are different from the wheels that normally come with the yellow DC Motors in that they have longer shafts so they will fit.

Also, starting in Version 0.5.2, each Wheel has tiny traction bumps around it, with actually do help with maneuverability on wood/tile floors.

At some point, I'll release a Wheel Customizer that you can use to make your own home-made 3D models for your wheels.

Also, the Wheels are the only parts where dimensions actually matter. See, if you print a wheel with a shaft that has too big or two small an adapter for the motor's shaft, it won't fit correctly. Proper wheels should be snug, and should require a bit of fiddling back and forth to get on the Motors properly. They should not be too easy to pull off, they shouldn't wobble, and they shouldn't be so tight you need vice grips to get them off.

So, you may want to test a print with a Wheel Shaft Tester before wasting plastic on a Wheel that won't fit. If you need any help with fitting the wheels, e-mail me at [matthew@botinabox.ca](mailto:matthew@botinabox.ca)
