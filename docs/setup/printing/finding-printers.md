CodeRcar is a 3D-printed robot kit, after all, so you're going to need to find a 3D printer you can use to make your own kit.

This sounds like a daunting task, but it probably isn't as difficult as you'd think. For one, you may own a 3D printer yourself. If you do, as long as its printing surface is at least 200mm x 100mm x 100mm, you should be able to print a CodeRcar.

If you are completely new to 3D printing, you'll want to do your research. At some point, I'll release a 3D printing for beginners website like this one, with tips/tricks on how to get started.

If you already know what you're doing, it's just a matter of slicing CodeRcar's STL files in a software like [Cura](https://ultimaker.com/en/products/ultimaker-cura-software), in order to generate a .gcode file that your printer can handle.

You're most likely to be using a Fused Deposition Modeller (FDM Printer), since that's the kind of 3D printer that is the cheapest, most popular, and generally most supported for hobbyists. If that's the case you will also need some 3D printing filament, and if you are in the US or Canada, Filament.ca is a great place to order some. I would recommend their [EconoFil Premium PLA](http://bit.ly/2Y3Miib), since it comes in 12 different colours, is fairly inexpensive, and works pretty well for a budget-friendly filament. PLA (Polylactic Acid) is a plant-based, bio-degradeable filament. If you're willing to spend a bit more, you can get [EcoTough PLA](http://bit.ly/2XYvWXR), which comes in almost any colour you could want, makes stronger prints, and

While it can be a bit brittle compared to other filaments like ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene), PLA doesn't stink like ABS *and* it has a lower melting point so it doesn't require as much electricity to heat it up.

At any rate, it may very well be that you don't have a 3D printer yourself, and you don't know anybody with one you can use. Don't despair, though; you may have some options:

- **Your local Makerspace** (many towns/cities nowadays have a community workshop or makerspace with machines like 3D printers and CNC mills that you can use/rent)

- **Your local library** (many libraries are beginning to get 3D printers. This can be a good option, but there are often time constraints that could be tricky to deal with, like 2 hours only etc.)

- **Your local college/university** (many post-secondary education centres have installed 3D printers available for use by students)

- **Your local high school/elementary school** (some high schools and even a few elementary schools are starting to get 3D printers, so check them)

- **Your local 3D Hub** (with the [3D Hubs](https://www.3dhubs.com/) service, you can get a print made at a nearby printer for a charge that is often quite reasonable)

- **brilliantPrintables by Bot-In-a-Box** (in the near future, if you're in the Barrie, Ontario, area, you can get your prints made by Bot-In-a-Box; more information coming soon)

If you feel like you've exhausted all of these options, and *still* can't find a printer, email me at [matthew@botinabox.ca](mailto:matthew@botinabox.ca) and I'll see if I can help.

Affiliate Link Disclaimer:

CodeRcar is an open-source project. As such, I don't make money off directly selling proprietary kits, but rely on affiliate e-commerce links to get a bit of income.
Though, obviously, there are a lot of places to buy things online, and if you can find a better price for an item somewhere else you may as well buy it there.


Some open-source projects have donation buttons, while others have links to the maintainers' product wishlists.
But, if you appreciate the work it took to create CodeRcar, consider the affiliate links like a combination of the two, except *you* get the things you need to build your very own CodeRcar.
