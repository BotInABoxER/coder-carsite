### Bill of Materials

This page is a list of materials that you will need to build your very own CodeRcar robot.

**Every product link on this page points to an eBay listing, but you can also buy the parts you need on the [Bot-In-a-Box Store](https://botinabox.ca/shop). On the store you'll also find Amazon.ca links for many of the same products, if you go onto a given product's page. To be honest, I would appreciate it if you bought the products you need from one of the eBay/Amazon links, and not from the store itself. (I make a bit of money off each sale either way, but with eBay/Amazon you don't pay any extra because I don't have to mark the orders up, and they'll ship faster.) Anyway, that's my little disclaimer. Enjoy CodeRcar's Site!**

It's worth mentioning that CodeRcar is a DIY kit, and while it has been designed to be as easy to build as possible, the process is quite involved, and requires access to both a 3D printer and a soldering iron. It is recommended to read through at least the Printing and Assembly portions of this site before diving in and purchasing all the components you'll need, if only to ensure you know into what it is you're getting yourself.

The following items are necessary for building a **CodeRcar Deci** (basically the absolute minimum to get a CodeRcar up and rolling):

- [A Raspberry Pi Zero W with soldered male headers](https://ebay.to/2vXeEi7) - A tiny computer 

- [DC Toy Motors with a 1:20 Gear Ratio (x4)](https://ebay.to/30iVtgx) - Vroom Vroom

- [L9110s Dual Motor Controller Modules (x2)](https://ebay.to/30k7G4v) - H-Bridges

- [A 5600mAh USB Power Bank Case](https://ebay.to/2YnAQhk) - A plastic case with a charging circuit

- [18650 Li-ion Batteries (x2)](https://ebay.to/2Hl1HFj) - Rechargeable Lithium-ion Batteries

- [A 32 GB microSD Card](https://ebay.to/2E3xrN5) - For the Raspberry Pi

- [M3 Socket Cap Hex Screws - 10mm (x100)](https://ebay.to/2YAyuMr) - Bigger screws

- [M2.5 Socket Cap Hex Screws - 8mm (x50)](https://ebay.to/2YAyuMr) - Smaller screws

- [30cm Dupont Jumper Wires (pack of 120)](https://ebay.to/2HoDgp9) - Handy solder-free cables

- [A Dual Micro USB Splitter Cable](https://ebay.to/2w0Enpy) - For giving the Pi power (**if you're only making a Deci try a normal [1.5m Micro USB Cable](https://ebay.to/2HuW1Hn)**)

<br />

The following tools may also come in handy:

- [A set of Allen Keys](https://ebay.to/2W1emFk) or a [Screwdriver Set](https://ebay.to/2VocQJd)

- [Mini Wire Strippers](https://ebay.to/30r4STo)

- [microSD Card Reader](https://ebay.to/2Q2rFA9)

- [Raspberry Pi Power Adapter](https://ebay.to/2JpZOcL)

<br />

Now, *these* additional items are for making a **CodeRcar Deka** (the base and a couple of sensors):

- [A Solderless Breadboard (with 400 tie-points)](https://ebay.to/2Yy6Tvh) - For building custom circuits 

- [A Breadboard Power Supply with Micro USB Input](https://ebay.to/2YsXxRm) - For powering the breadboard...

- [A Mini USB Cable](https://ebay.to/2E5WYFi) - For connecting the Pi to the Arduino (only for initial programming purposes, though)

- [An MPU6050 Sensor Breakout Board](https://ebay.to/2JDDwTX) - An accelerometer, gyroscope, and thermometer all-in-one!

- [An HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor](https://ebay.to/2VkJJqd) - A distance-measuring sensor

- [An Arduino Nano-compatible Board](https://ebay.to/2vUEt2f) - A less-powerful tiny computer designed specifically for programming custom circuits

<br />

Additionally, *these* items along with the ones above can be used to make a **CodeRcar Hecto** (the base, a couple of sensors, and more!):


- [A ISD1820 Microphone/Speaker Module](https://ebay.to/2JhSwHX) - A microphone and speaker in one

- [A Nokia 5110 LCD Screen](https://ebay.to/2YuIQNM) - A little 84x48 LCD screen for displaying some graphics!

- [An RGB LED Module](https://ebay.to/2YwCY6K) - All the colours of the rainbow can be programmed into this little lightbulb!

- [A Breadboard Starter Kit](https://ebay.to/2vUE67R) - Some buttons, resistors, potentiometers, lights and stuff for playing around with your breadboard

- [An 8x8 LED Matrix (MAX7219)](https://ebay.to/2WNZR5a) - A shiny LED matrix                                                                                

<br />

And, if you want to take the Raspberry Pi Zero W out of its case and use it as a mini desktop computer (it's not really meant for that, but don't let that stop you), you might need these things:

- [Mini HDMI to HDMI Adapter](https://ebay.to/2HoKPw9)

- [HDMI Cable](https://ebay.to/30jvTIo)

- [USB OTG HUB](https://ebay.to/2vZmk3g)

- [Wireless Keyboard/Mouse](https://ebay.to/2VER7BC)

<br />

Finally, if you want to just use the Pi Zero W with an older TV monitor that doesn't support HDMI, you could try some of these (though only the ones that work with your particular setup):

- [HDMI to RCA Converter](https://ebay.to/2VtEIM8)

- [RCA Cable](https://ebay.to/2VA7JdG)

- [HDMI to DVI Cable](https://ebay.to/2YyydcR)

- [HDMI to VGA Converter](https://ebay.to/2vYdJ0U)

- [VGA Cable](https://ebay.to/2HrOYiI)

- [RF Modulator](https://ebay.to/2VmkbJ3)

<br />

Phew, all done! :)

Affiliate Link Disclaimer:

CodeRcar is an open-source project. As such, I don't make money off directly selling proprietary kits, but rely on affiliate e-commerce links to get a bit of income.
Though, obviously, there are a lot of places to buy things online, and if you can find a better price for an item somewhere else you may as well buy it there.

Some open-source projects have donation buttons, while others have links to the maintainers' product wishlists.
But, if you appreciate the work it took to create CodeRcar, consider the affiliate links like a combination of the two, except *you* get the things you need to build your very own CodeRcar.
