### Bill of Materials

This page is a list of materials that you will need to build your very own Project Rover robot.

Included are e-commerce links to purchase, and their current approximate prices in Canadian dollars (* means shipping is included in the price).

It's worth mentioning that Project Rover is a DIY kit, and while it has been designed to be as easy to build as possible, the process is quite involved, and requires access to both a 3D printer and a soldering iron. It is recommended to read through at least the Printing and Assembly portions of this site before diving in and purchasing all the components you'll need, if only to ensure you know into what it is you're getting yourself.

Affiliate Link Disclaimer:

Project Rover is an open-source project. As such, I don't make money off directly selling proprietary kits, but rely on affiliate e-commerce links to get a bit of income.
Though, obviously, there are a lot of places to buy things online, and if you can find a better price for an item somewhere else you may as well buy it there.

Some open-source projects have donation buttons, while others have links to the maintainers' product wishlists.
But, if you appreciate the work it took to create Project Rover, consider the affiliate links like a combination of the two, except *you* get the things you need to build your very own Project Rover.
