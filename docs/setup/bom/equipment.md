### Equipment

Below is a list of some equipment that could come in handy while you're building a Project Rover. Unlike the materials, these are optional, and most things are only useful in a specific use case.

The Mini HDMI Adapter, microSD Card Reader, Raspberry Pi Power Adapter, and HDMI Cable will most come in handy, and if you want to use a mouse or keyboard with your Raspberry Pi Zero W, you should get a USB OTG Hub with/without Ethernet.

The HDMI-to-VGA Adapter with a VGA Cord is useful if you want to use your Raspberry Pi Zero W with an older computer monitor that doesn't support HDMI.

The HDMI-to-RCA Adapter and RCA Cable could be helpful if you want to use an old-school CRTube TV as video output (and if *it* doesn't support RCA, an RF Modulator could help you connect RCA Cables to its Coaxial jack) or an older stereo as audio output.

Finally, the Raspberry Pi Zero W is WiFi-enabled, but if for some reason you need to connect it to a wired Internet connection (for example, you don't have a WiFi router at home and you want to install the latest software updates on your Pi) you could use the Micro USB OTG Hub with Ethernet to connect the Pi to the back of your modem.

Affiliate Link Disclaimer:

Project Rover is an open-source project. As such, I don't make money off directly selling proprietary kits, but rely on affiliate e-commerce links to get a bit of income.
Though, obviously, there are a lot of places to buy things online, and if you can find a better price for an item somewhere else you may as well buy it there.


Some open-source projects have donation buttons, while others have links to the maintainers' product wishlists.
But, if you appreciate the work it took to create Project Rover, consider the affiliate links like a combination of the two, except *you* get the things you need to build your very own Project Rover.
