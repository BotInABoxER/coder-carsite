Project Rover is a low-cost, open-source, modular robot car that you can build with 3D-printed parts and things you can easily find online!

Project Rover is meant to be a fun, easy-to-learn, powerful education tool, a case-in-point that *anybody* can make something truly special when given access to the right materials and equipment. That's what Bot-In-a-Box Educational Robotics is all about: equipping kids and adults alike with idea that making a robot doesn't have to be hard, complicated, or expensive. 

Furthermore, Project Rover is a bit of an experiment in open-source, and the documentation found on this website should allow you to use all open-source software, should you choose to do so. 

Be safe out there, have fun, and remember that with Bot-In-a-Box, the Box is just the Beginning!
